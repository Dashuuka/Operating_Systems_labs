# Lab2: Thread Creation and Array Processing
This project demonstrates the creation and synchronization of threads in a Windows environment using the Windows API. The program consists of three threads: main, min_max, and average. The main thread creates an array of integers, spawns the min_max and average threads, and waits for their completion. The min_max thread finds the minimum and maximum elements in the array, while the average thread calculates the average value. Finally, the main thread replaces the minimum and maximum elements with the average value and outputs the modified array. Built with CMake and tested with Google Test.
